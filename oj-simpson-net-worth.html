Simpson Net Worth How Rich is Simpson in 2024?</h2></heading><div></div><content class=sk3-margin-v-full><p>In 2023, O.J. Simpson’s net worth is estimated to be around $3 million. His wealth was primarily accumulated through his successful career as a professional football player, sports commentator, and actor. However, his financial status took a significant hit following his highly publicized murder trial and subsequent civil lawsuit, where he was found liable for $33.5 million in damages. He still owes roughly $70 million, including accumulated interest, to the Goldman family as a result of the civil judgment. Simpson receives a generous NFL pension, which is protected by state law and cannot be claimed by the Goldman family. His other sources of income include royalties from books and television appearances, rental income from real estate investments, and returns from low-risk investments such as bank deposits and government bonds. Despite his financial setbacks, Simpson still leads a relatively comfortable lifestyle, owning luxury vehicles and a grand residence in California.</p><h3>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>O.J.
